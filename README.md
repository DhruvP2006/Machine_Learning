- Types of ML

  1. Supervised Learning - Labeled Inputs, each item is Labeled.
  2. Unsupervised Learning - Unlabled Inputs, where items are classified into groups based on similarities
  3. Reinforcement Learning - Training a model by giving a positive reaction to the model when the predicted output for a given input is correct and and negative reation when the prediction is wrong.

- Features
  a. Qualitative

  1. Nominal Data - Data which can be classified into various group but has not inherent order. eg: Genders, Nationality.
  2. Ordinal Data - Data which can be classified into various group and has inherent order. eg: Stages of Life, Human Moods etc.

  b. Quantitative

  1. Continous - eg: Length, Temperature etc.
  2. Discrete - eg: No. of something

- Types of Outputs (Supervised Learning)
  a. Classification - predict discrete classes

  1. Multiclass Classification - eg: Apple, Orange, Banana etc.
  2. Binary Classification - eg: Apple / Not Apple(Orange, Banana etc.)

  b. Regression - predict continous values eg: price of stocks, house etc.
